I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at Lund University (Sweden) in Tobias Uller group (see https://feiner-uller-group.se/ for more info).

My research interests include community ecology, ecophysiology, and the effects of environmental change on populations and ecosystems. I am particularly interested in topics related to conservation and invasion biology. 

## 2024-ongoing • Post doc project

Institution: Lund University (Sweden)

Mentoring: Tobias Uller

My postdoc includes two main projects:
1)  Explore the resilience and adaptation of small island populations of the Mediterranean wall lizards
2)  Study the evolution of thermal traits in reptiles

## 2021-2024 • PhD project

Institution: Research Institute on Insect Biology (IRBI) - Tours University (France)

Supervision: Sylvain Pincebourde, Olivier Chabrerie and Vincent Foray

My PhD thesis focused on the role of polyphagy and thermal plasticity in the invasive success of Drosophila suzukii.

Globally, the apparently inexorable increase of biological invasions and their resulting damage raise questions about the factors that influence invasion success. In this project, I considered the spotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii, which provides an exemplar as a highly successful invasive species. It is an ideal model because of the rapidity of its invasion and the important economic losses resulting from its ability to oviposit in healthy fruit. 
I explored the mechanisms that could contribute to its rapid global invasion. In particular, I considered its polyphagy, the alternative resources it can use in seasons when cultivated fruit are not available, as well as the local, landscape-scale and climatic factors that influence its infestations. I also investigated its behavioural thermoregulation capacities and the plasticity of its thermal preference, traits that allow a better understanding of the ability of D. suzukii to exploit favourable microhabitats. Finally, I explored the effect of the interaction between food resource, temperature and the presence of the bacterial symbiont Wolbachia on the performance of D. suzukii and its oviposition choices.
